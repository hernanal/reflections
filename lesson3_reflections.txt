When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  * When you are working on a project with other people who do not have access to your local machine. Or if you want to be able to access your work from other machines.

  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  	* There may be some changes you do not want on your local log. Maybe Git doesn't update the log as often as you would like.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	* Branches are extensions of a local repository. You would use a branch when you want to have separate aspects of a repository. For example, if you were working on the master branch of a computer game and you want to make the game easier without effecting the actual game. You would create a branch called easy-mode. 

	* A clone is a copy of a repository. You can clone from a remote repository or a local one. You would use this any time you are trying to copy a repository to your local machine. 

	* A fork is the same as a clone except it is used only to make a copy of a repository on GitHub. You would use this any time you want to make a copy of a repository on GitHub to add to your personal GitHub profile.
