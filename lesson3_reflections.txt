When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  * When you are working on a project with other people who do not have access to your local machine. Or if you want to be able to access your work from other machines.

  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  	* There may be some changes you do not want on your local log. Maybe Git doesn't update the log as often as you would like.
