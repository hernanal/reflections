How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	* The staging area is where you put files you are developing. A repository is a place you can store files. You can go back and look at previous versions of those files and what changes have been committed. The working directory is the path to the repository. It is where the repository is stored.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	* Only move the modified files to the staging area when you are ready to commit a logical change.
