How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	* The staging area is where you put files you are developing. A repository is a place you can store files. You can go back and look at previous versions of those files and what changes have been committed. The working directory is the path to the repository. It is where the repository is stored.
